            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Wellness 131 Alumni website!</p>
            <p>In today's fast-paced world, taking a few minutes to meditate can make a big difference in our mental and emotional health.</p>
            <p>Compassion meditation helps us lead our lives with increased emotional awareness and emotional intelligence. This practice is shown to benefit ourselves, but also can help improve our relationships and our attention to the world around us.</p>
            <p>This website keeps track of the meditation practices we covered each week and links some meditation recordings you can revisit. I invite you to explore this website and let it help you in your continued practice. I wish all of you the best!</p>
            <h4>Motivation for this site</h4>
            <p>Meditation has become an important part of my week, and offers profound benefits that extend far beyond moments of tranquility. It serves as a cornerstone of emotional well-being and helps to bring balance and mindfulness to life's challenges.</p>
            <p>This course reinforced the importance of cultivating mindfulness and compassion in our daily lives, inspiring me to create a platform where individuals can continue to access resources beyond the duration of the class. Compassion meditation has been shown to equip individuals with invaluable tools for self-reflection and emotional resilience. Having begun to witness these changes myself, I am hopeful that this site will help myself and others keep up with practice beyond this course.</p>
            <h4>About me</h4>
            <p>I loved the community created in this class, and found that it truly added to the feeling of stepping into a calm space during a busy day.</p>
            <p>I initially took this course not knowing anything about meditation, and have been fully convinced by these ten weeks to work to integrate it into my life. I hope to bring with me a sense of gratitude for all I have and an emotional resilience that helps carry me through challenging moments.</p>
